## [0.0.3] — 2026-03-28

### Added
- **`rlsl-iroh` crate** — tunnel LSL streams over iroh peer-to-peer QUIC connections
  - Source/sink architecture: streams forwarded transparently, re-published as local LSL outlets
  - Zero data loss guarantee via reliable QUIC streams, unbounded channels, 32K-sample inlet buffer
  - 6 compression codecs: none, lz4, zstd (L1/L3), snappy, delta-lz4
  - Low-latency QUIC transport tuning (immediate ACKs, zero ACK delay, 1ms initial RTT)
  - Optional lossy datagram mode behind `lossy-datagrams` feature flag
  - In-process benchmark (`rlsl-iroh bench`) with zero-loss assertion
  - Continuous stream discovery (`--continuous`)
  - Connection tickets for easy node-id exchange
  - 23 tests (8 unit, 9 protocol roundtrip, 6 end-to-end iroh tunnel)
- **Benchmark suite** in `figures/`
  - 43-configuration sweep: codecs × channels × sample rates × formats
  - 8 auto-generated charts (codec latency, channel/rate scaling, format comparison, etc.)
  - `run_benchmarks.sh` + `plot_benchmarks.py` for reproducibility
  - All 43 runs: 0.00% data loss, ~52µs mean latency at 10 MB/s throughput

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `rlsl-cli` — unified CLI tool combining gen, record, convert, bench, and list commands
- `rlsl-fuzz` — fuzz testing targets for protocol parsers and XML DOM
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — detailed architecture documentation with crate dependency graph
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — contribution guidelines
- `SECURITY.md` — vulnerability disclosure policy
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file
- `Dockerfile` — container image for rlsl-rec and rlsl-gen
- Comprehensive unit tests for `sample`, `xml_dom`, `postproc`, `signal_quality`, `clock`,
  `send_buffer`, `config`, and `stream_info` modules
- Criterion benchmarks for sample serialization, XML DOM operations, and push/pull throughput
- Workspace-level examples: `multi_stream.rs`, `markers.rs`, `recording.rs`
- `cargo-deny` configuration for license and dependency auditing
- Cross-platform CI matrix (Linux x86_64, macOS aarch64, Windows x86_64)
- npm publish workflow for WASM package

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-28

### Added
- **rlsl**: Pure-Rust LSL implementation with full protocol 1.00 + 1.10 support
  - `StreamInfo` — stream metadata with XPath-like query matching
  - `StreamOutlet` — publish data on the network
  - `StreamInlet` — receive data with automatic recovery
  - UDP multicast/broadcast discovery (IPv4 + IPv6 dual-stack)
  - TCP data streaming with protocol handshake
  - NTP-like time correction probing
  - Timestamp post-processing (dejitter, clocksync, monotonize)
  - Mutable XML DOM for `<desc>` metadata
  - Signal quality metrics (SNR, jitter, dropout detection)
  - Config file loading (`lsl_api.cfg`)
- **rlsl-sys**: C ABI shared library — 162/162 `extern "C"` symbols, drop-in for liblsl
- **exg**: XDF file writer and `NumericSample` trait
- **rlsl-rec**: Recording engine with XDF, Parquet, and HDF5 output + ratatui TUI
- **rrlsl-rec-gui**: eGUI recorder with live signal viewer and stream inspector
- **rlsl-py**: Python bindings via PyO3 + numpy (StreamInfo, StreamOutlet, StreamInlet, resolver)
- **rlsl-wasm**: WebSocket bridge server + WASM browser client
- **rlsl-gen**: Synthetic signal generator (sine, square, noise, chirp, sawtooth, counter)
- **rlsl-bench**: Throughput and latency benchmarking tool
- **rlsl-convert**: Offline format converter (XDF → Parquet, XDF → CSV, Parquet → CSV)
- CI workflows for lint, test (Linux/macOS/Windows), WASM, and Python wheels
- Release workflow with GitHub Releases + PyPI publishing

### Known Gaps
- mDNS/Bonjour discovery not implemented (LSL uses UDP multicast as primary discovery)
